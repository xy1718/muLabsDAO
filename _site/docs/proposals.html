<p>How do bottom-up initiatives get funded? How do you get funds to do something without a budget process?</p>

<p>Answer: If you want something that needs funding, form a Proposal. That is, find others that want the same thing and are willing to “make the effort” for it with their own resources until we launch a <a href="project.html">project</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-proposal">What is a Proposal?</h2>

<p>A Proposal is a loosely coupled interest group of people who want to co-fund an initiative.</p>

<p>In some cases it does make sense for muLabsDAO as a whole to fund an initiative; for smaller initiatives the <a href="board-of-trust.html">board of trust</a> can just go ahead and do it. For larger initiatives we may go for a <a href="decisions.html">consensus decision</a> at our next scrum meeting.</p>

<p>But when in doubt (or if in a hurry), go for opt-in and just form a Proposal. Because it’s just so much easier. We may of course decide later this cost should be of muLabsDAO, and in that case simply close the Proposal.</p>

<h2 id="sometimes-proposals-dont-have-to-pay">Sometimes Proposals don’t have to pay</h2>

<p>Proposals are expected to run at a loss (they are basically cost centers), so each Proposals Account can be seen as a short-term loan from muLabsDAO to a group of participants. Each participant should expect to receive an benefit from muLabsDAO at some point, to cover their part of the cost.</p>

<p>However, sometimes that doesn’t happen. Sometimes muLabsDAO will waive the debt. For example because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Proposals ended up spending money that clearly was to the benefit of muLabsDAO as a whole, so muLabsDAO will foot the bill.</li>
  <li>The costs were so low that it’s not worth the administrative hassle of invoicing all participants.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second case is very important, because it basically gives the <a href="board-of-trust.html">board of trust</a> permission to avoid a bunch of micromanagement and administrative overhead. Think of it as our “yeah whatever” budget.</p>

<p>By waiving the debt, muLabsDAO can avoid unnecessary administration of costs that are clearly in the common interest, or clearly too small to bother with.</p>

<p>The Proposals model make it easy for people to collaborate on stuff without a bunch of upfront budgeting or permission-seeking.</p>

<h2 id="sample-proposal">Sample Proposal</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use a open-source structure of source code to co-create the muLabsDAO DNA</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="benefits-of-forming-a-proposals">Benefits of forming a Proposals</h2>

<p>The main benefit to forming a Proposals is that we reduce the need for centralized decision making, and maximize people’s economic freedom.</p>

<p>But why Proposals at all? Can’t people just “huddle up and do it”? True, but the Proposals model offer some advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Transparency</strong> - all Proposals are listed (at least the long-lived ones)</li>
  <li><strong>Engagement</strong> - it is easier to get involved if you know what’s going on</li>
  <li><strong>Established form of collaboration</strong> - the initiator and participants of a Proposals know what it means.</li>
  <li><strong>Economies of scale</strong> - each Proposals has a Proposals Account that is administered by the <a href="board-of-trust.html">board of trust</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Responsibility</strong> - Proposals Accounts only appear when there are actual <em>individuals</em> who are prepared to pay. This reduces the risk that muLabsDAO as a whole spends money on stuff that isn’t important, or that very few people care about.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-required-of-a-proposals">What is required of a Proposals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A description of the purpose of the Proposals, how collaboration is done and who has joined</li>
  <li>All Proposals are open for any people to join.</li>
  <li>Every new Proposals is announced in our <a href="https://discord.gg/SvFVXTQsy4">discord</a>.</li>
