<p>Formally, muLabsDAO doesn’t really have a focus area. Nothing about our model is specific to any domain or industry. Well, there are some <a href="industries-that-we-avoid.html">industries that we avoid</a>. Our strategy (it’s really more about how we operate) is to focus in two main areas:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Develop software and hardware solutions using exponential technologies to improve intelligence, happiness and longevity</strong>. Mostly longer engagements and close to full-time.</li>
  <li><strong>Build singular Neurofeedback Experiences/Sessions/Events exploring the boundaries between science and art to learn more about how to quantify the self</strong>. Mostly shorter engagements or part-time.</li>
</ol>

<p>That is, most people of the team happen to spend most of their time in one of those two areas. Some have one foot in each though. The key thing is “keep the flow with the loops” - positive feedback cycles that keep getting stronger and stronger.</p>

<h2 id="positive-feedback-loops">Positive feedback loops</h2>

<p><strong>Left loop:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Competent &amp; motivated people do a better job, which leads to happy customers.</li>
  <li>Happy customers give us a good reputation.</li>
  <li>Good reputation increases our motivation further &amp; attracts new competent people to our DAO.</li>
  <li>GOTO 1</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Right loop:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Competent &amp; motivated people do a better job, which leads to happy customers.</li>
  <li>More and happier customers leads to higher profit.</li>
  <li>Higher profit means people can afford to spend time learning new things (instead of trying to make every hour customer-debitable), and feel more safe doing so.</li>
  <li>Taking time to explore and learn new things together makes us more motivated and more competent!</li>
  <li>GOTO 1</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="dao-examples-and-impact">DAO: Examples and Impact</h2>

<p>The first DAO began with Ethereum in 2016 and lasted only a few months before it was hacked due to an exploited vulnerability in the source code. While
the original DAO was short-lived, many other DAOs have proliferated in the years since. The earliest DAOs were treasury management systems, designed to allow token holders to determine the direction of a project, new features, engineering roadmap, and business strategy. Newer DAOs include freelancer guilds where remote workers can pool their talents
to find clients, investment DAOs where members can comanage a portfolio of assets, and media DAOs that have unique incentives to encourage engagement and monetize content. Uniswap, a popular decentralized exchange, formed a DAO when it distributed governance tokens (UNI) to every address that had used the platform before Sept. 1, 2020. Friends With Benefits is a social DAO where token holders can buy season passes for access to exclusive events and content.</p>

<p>Think of DAOs as co-ops for the web. DAOs facilitate the collective ownership and creation of value. While still in their infancy, DAOs offer promising approaches to classic coordination problems such as managing resources and aligning incentives.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-we-run-our-dao">How do we run our DAO?</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lean &amp; Agile</strong> - our approach is based on lean and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile</a> principles.</li>
  <li><strong>Meritocracy &amp; Consensus</strong> - we don’t have titles, managers, or reporting structures. Instead we are a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy">meritocracy</a>, which basically means your power to influence stuff is based on your competence and engagement. Decisions are made mostly using consensus (<a href="decisions.html">here’s how</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Ask for forgiveness rather than permission</strong> - if you want to start or change something, go ahead! The default answer to any request or idea is “Sure! If you believe in it and want to put time into it!”. Very few mistakes are fatal or irreversible, so we encourage each other to just try things rather than seek permission.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple models</strong> - being a bunch of smart people and nerds, we can come up with detailed rules and structures for any kind problem. But we really try not to! We don’t want to overcomplicate things, and prefer to err on the side of simplicity. Better to have too few rules than too many, and better to follow high level guiding principles than low level detailed procedures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-we-finance-mulabsdao">How do we finance muLabsDAO?</h2>

<p>Scientific research has long been a top-down process, with decisions made by the people with the finances. These people normally represent governments or large pharmaceuticals, who usually base their investments on which project has the highest potential to succeed: a risk-averse approach. DeSci organizations can utilize tools such as NFTs and cryptocurrencies to community-fund research, for example, via Defi protocols or by monetizing IP NFTs, essentially putting the power of decision-making in the hands of the DAO and its participants.</p>

<p>We are trying to raise funds with our BioNFTs collections, promoting auctions in singular events like <a href="a-journey-to-neurofeedback.html">A Journey to a neurofeedback</a>.</p>
