<p>How do we make decisions in a decentralized organization with no managers?</p>

<h2 id="why-dont-we-have-a-well-defined-decision-making-process">Why don’t we have a well defined decision-making process?</h2>

<p>Different types of decisions need a different process. It would be crazy to involve the whole team in decisions like which type of whiteboard pens to buy. And it would be crazy to NOT involve the whole team if we needed to decide where we will be the new location for the next event.</p>

<p>So it’s not a good idea to have one single well-defined decision process for everything. And it’s not a good idea to try to list all potential decision types and create a well-defined process for each type, the list would be too long and complex, and there would be too many gray zones.</p>

<h2 id="well-how-do-we-make-decisions-then">Well, how do we make decisions then?</h2>

<p>You don’t need a well-defined decision process in order to make decisions. If that was the case, the world would stand still :)</p>

<p>Instead, we follow these principles/guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The person driving an issue or <a href="proposals.html">proposal</a>. owns the decision process.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A decision is only a decision if there is a “puller” who follows up on the execution.</strong> (we can use the term “driver”)</li>
  <li><strong>Important decisions should be documented in and emailed to everyone</strong></li>
  <li>Some decisions lead to funded <a href="projects.html">projects</a>, when the people involved vote and the <a href="proposals.html">proposal</a> win. To get funding, there needs to be almost two (x2) “pullers” throughout the whole project.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> If I want muLabsDAO to collaborate with industry/company/project X, then I’m the one driving that question Y and I pick the decision process.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-pick-a-decision-process">How do I pick a decision process?</h2>

<p>Here are some examples of different decisions processes on a scale from “fast” to “well-anchored”.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Own decision</strong>. Decide yourself without talking to anyone.</li>
  <li><strong>Own decision with team input</strong>. Ask for input from the team, but then make the decision yourself.</li>
  <li><strong>Own decision with team-anchoring</strong>. Ask for input from the team, suggest a decision, check if the team is OK with it before closing the decision.</li>
  <li><strong>Team decision</strong>. Facilitate a decision from the whole team (using consensus, with majority vote as fallback if we can’t reach consensus).</li>
</ul>

<p>The term “team” in this case really means “those who are affected by the decision”. Sometimes the whole team, sometimes just a few individuals.</p>

<p>These decisions processes can be combined. For example, start by getting input from the whole team, then suggest a decision and anchor with those people who are most directly affected.</p>

<p>For simple decisions, this communication can happen via email or an online poll. For more complex or sensitive decisions, face-to-face conversation is better.</p>

<p>Some things to consider when choosing a decisions process:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Who is affected?</strong> Only you? You and a few others? The whole team?</li>
  <li><strong>How important is this question to you?</strong> How important is it to those who are affected? Is it a critical decision or trivial one?</li>
  <li><strong>Is the decision reversible?</strong> Most decisions are. What is the consequence of making the “wrong” decision, and who is affected by that?</li>
  <li><strong>How easy or hard is the decision?</strong> How easy is it to reach consensus with all people affected?</li>
  <li><strong>How urgent is the decision?</strong> What is the consequence of delaying the decision, or not making a decision at all?</li>
  <li><strong>Who are you?</strong> The decision process may vary depending on your perspective – consultant, board member, etc. May also depend on how long you’ve been at muLabsDAO (if you are new and unsure you might need to seek more anchoring from people).</li>
  <li><strong>Is the outcome affected by laws?</strong> Some decisions must be aligned with the board of trust to assurance the all the legal issues according the country.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the day it’s about balancing risk. If you make the decision yourself it will be fast, but you risk a backlash if others don’t support it. If you seek 100% consensus you may get a better decision with better support, but it could take time – especially for questions where people have opposing opinions.</p>

<p>There is no perfect process, so seek a balance between these extremes! We most often end up in the middle of the scale – “own decision with team input” or “own decision with team anchoring” (where “team” isn’t necessarily the whole team)</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-still-feel-unsure-of-which-decision-process-to-use">What if I still feel unsure of which decision process to use?</h2>

<p>Here are some options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Take a chance!</strong> “Better to ask for forgiveness than permission”. Most decisions are reversible, so you don’t really need to be afraid of making the “wrong” decision or using the “wrong” decision process. Just accept feedback and learn.</li>
  <li><strong>Talk to a muLabsDAO colleague</strong>, for example someone who has been around longer and can give examples of what has worked in the past.</li>
  <li><strong>Check if someone else can drive</strong> the question for you (or with you). Preferably someone who is strongly engaged in the question. It’s nice to pair-drive a decision, so you can always ask on the team mailing list to find a co-driver.</li>
  <li><strong>Escalate the decision</strong> to the <a href="board-of-trust.html">board of Trust</a>.</li>
</ul>
