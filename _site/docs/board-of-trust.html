<p>In most “companies”, the board is appointed by the owners to represent them so that the management group, headed by the CEO, runs the company according to the directives from the owners and the board. We are a Descentralized Autonomus Organization creating our rules and bias.</p>

<p>At muLabsDAO, this works a little differently. First of all, <a href="ownership-model.html">we invite all the colaborators to become owners after 2 years</a>, and second, we hold a yearly election of the board members where all  (owners or not) have the right to vote. Since <a href="decisions.html">we have gotten rid of the CEO role</a>, and since we have very autonomous, there is really quite little to manage.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-the-board-do">What does the board do?</h2>

<p>The board have monthly board meetings. The most important responsibilities are to make sure the financial aspect of muLabsDAO is OK. The meetings are open for everybody to attend if they wish.</p>

<p>Managing the finances involves keeping an eye on the liquidity to be able to do day-to-day business and to aim for a zero result at the end of the fiscal year.</p>

<p>This is the template for our monthly board meetings.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Election of meeting secretary, chairman and attestant</li>
  <li>Schedule next meeting</li>
  <li>Information round</li>
  <li>Walk-through of previous protocol and action points</li>
  <li>Walk-through of economy</li>
  <li>Important calendar events</li>
  <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
  <li>Free topics
    <ul>
      <li>Topic suggestions on post-it notes</li>
      <li>Prioritization</li>
      <li>Work through the topics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-do-we-elect-the-board">How do we elect the board?</h2>

<p>We elect the board annually; our board consists of four people</p>

<ol>
  <li>Leader</li>
  <li>Board member 1</li>
  <li>Board member 2</li>
  <li>Board alternate (3)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-current-election-process">The current election process</h3>

<p>Before the election starts, people who volunteer to run for the board of trust put their name up for consideration on a dedicated wall somewhere. Often, there is some flattering going on to encourage people to volunteer. We usually end up with two or three candidates for the Leader position, and some additional people volunteering to make up the rest of the board.</p>

<p>For each position on the board:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Any people may nominate anybody.</li>
  <li>Nominees who accept the nomination are given the opportunity to offer a short motivation for why to vote for them.</li>
  <li>Each people casts a vote by writing the name of their favourite candidate on a piece of paper, and putting it in a basket in the middle of the circle.</li>
  <li>When everyone has voted, 2-3 people count the votes in front of the group. The candidate with the largest number of votes is announced the winner without further ado.</li>
</ol>

<p>We repeat this process until all four positions are filled.</p>

<p>Since we vote for one position at a time, we have the possibility to vote for a strong team. Let’s say the leader is an intuitive agile coach, then, maybe, people will vote for a thoughtful programmer in the next round to balance the team.
Past practice that has emerged, the board usually consist of one from our office staff, one programmer and one agile coach.</p>
