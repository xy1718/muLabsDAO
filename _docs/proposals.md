Proposals
=========

How do bottom-up initiatives get funded? How do you get funds to do something without a budget process?

Answer: If you want something that needs funding, form a Proposal. That is, find others that want the same thing and are willing to "make the effort" for it with their own resources until we launch a [project](project.html). 

What is a Proposal?
-------------------

A Proposal is a loosely coupled interest group of people who want to co-fund an initiative. 

In some cases it does make sense for muLabsDAO as a whole to fund an initiative; for smaller initiatives the [board of trust](board-of-trust.html) can just go ahead and do it. For larger initiatives we may go for a [consensus decision](decisions.html) at our next scrum meeting.

But when in doubt (or if in a hurry), go for opt-in and just form a Proposal. Because it's just so much easier. We may of course decide later this cost should be of muLabsDAO, and in that case simply close the Proposal.

Sometimes Proposals don't have to pay
-------------------------------------

Proposals are expected to run at a loss (they are basically cost centers), so each Proposals Account can be seen as a short-term loan from muLabsDAO to a group of participants. Each participant should expect to receive an benefit from muLabsDAO at some point, to cover their part of the cost.

However, sometimes that doesn't happen. Sometimes muLabsDAO will waive the debt. For example because:

-   The Proposals ended up spending money that clearly was to the benefit of muLabsDAO as a whole, so muLabsDAO will foot the bill.
-   The costs were so low that it's not worth the administrative hassle of invoicing all participants.

The second case is very important, because it basically gives the [board of trust](board-of-trust.html) permission to avoid a bunch of micromanagement and administrative overhead. Think of it as our "yeah whatever" budget.

By waiving the debt, muLabsDAO can avoid unnecessary administration of costs that are clearly in the common interest, or clearly too small to bother with.

The Proposals model make it easy for people to collaborate on stuff without a bunch of upfront budgeting or permission-seeking.


Sample Proposal
---------------

-   **Use a open-source structure of source code to co-create the muLabsDAO DNA** 

Benefits of forming a Proposals
-------------------------------

The main benefit to forming a Proposals is that we reduce the need for centralized decision making, and maximize people's economic freedom.

But why Proposals at all? Can't people just "huddle up and do it"? True, but the Proposals model offer some advantages:

-   **Transparency** - all Proposals are listed (at least the long-lived ones)
-   **Engagement** - it is easier to get involved if you know what's going on
-   **Established form of collaboration** - the initiator and participants of a Proposals know what it means.
-   **Economies of scale** - each Proposals has a Proposals Account that is administered by the [board of trust](board-of-trust.html).
-   **Responsibility** - Proposals Accounts only appear when there are actual *individuals* who are prepared to pay. This reduces the risk that muLabsDAO as a whole spends money on stuff that isn't important, or that very few people care about.

What is required of a Proposals
-------------------------------

-   A description of the purpose of the Proposals, how collaboration is done and who has joined
-   All Proposals are open for any people to join.
-   Every new Proposals is announced in our [discord](https://discord.gg/SvFVXTQsy4).
