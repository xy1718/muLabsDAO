Conflict handling
=================

Conflict is inevitable in any organization because, well, Humans :)

The way we deal with conflict is really important - some conflicts are healthy and productive and drive improvement - other conflicts are ugly and political and suck the soul out of the culture. We obviously want more of the former and less of the latter!

Conflict handling gets a bit tricky with organizations like muLabsDAO, with everything bottom-up and no managers. 

Inspired by the book [Reinventing Organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com), we've learned that self-organization at scale really needs an explicit conflict handling strategy, a simple process that everyone needs to be bought into.

We agreed on this 3-step conflict escalation process:

Our conflict handling process
---------------------------------------------------

**Step 1:** I take responsibility for bringing up and sorting out any gravel with the involved person(s) ASAP, or accept it and let it go for real (= don't complain). If someone brings up gravel with me, I will meet up.

*... if the conflict didn't get solved:*

**Step 2:** Invite a facilitator/mediator that both parties trust. The facilitator's role is to help the parties find a mutually acceptable solution, not try to force his/her own solution upon the conflicting parties.

*... if the conflict didn't get solved:*

**Step 3:** board of trust meeting at muLabsDAO [discord](https://discord.gg/SvFVXTQsy4) ASAP with the involved parties.

The purpose of our conflict handling process is to catch small conflicts before it becomes a big war!
