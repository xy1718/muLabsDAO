Communication
=============

Our **main internal communication channels** are:

-   [muLabsDAO Discord](https://discord.gg/SvFVXTQsy4).
-   Whatsap, Telegram ...
-   [Board of trust meetings](board.html) scrum every week.


Where we **store info**:

-   GitHub - a github personal account for shared code and, well, the muLabsDAO DNA that you are reading right now.

How we **communicate with the outside world**:

-   muArts - [https://muarts.tech/](https://muarts.tech/)
-   Twitter - our twitter handle is [@muLabsDAO](https://twitter.com/muLabsDAO)
-   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/muartstech)
-   ... but the biggest channel of communication is of course the personal and informal channels - tweeting, blogging, and talking to friends and customers. Together we have a huge network!
