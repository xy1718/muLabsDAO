Our **main internal communication channels** are:

-   [Telegram](https://t.me/+eHoS0wjxc_QwM2Y0).
-   [Board of trust - meetings](board-of-trust.html) scrum every week.
-   Whatsap.

Where we **store info**:

-   GitHub - a github personal account for shared code and, well, the muLabsDAO DNA that you are reading right now.

How we **communicate with the outside world**:

-   muArts site - [https://muarts.tech/](https://muarts.tech/)
-   Twitter - our twitter handle is [@muLabsDAO](https://twitter.com/muLabsDAO)
-   [Facebook muArts](https://www.facebook.com/muartstech)
-   ... but the biggest channel of communication is of course the personal and informal channels - tweeting, blogging, and talking with everybody. Together we have a huge network!
