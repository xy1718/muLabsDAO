Visions
=======

muLabsDAO itself is just a platform and doesn't have a Vision (with a Big V). However, many of the *people* at muLabsDAO do have a vision. Here are the most widely shared visions:

**Vision 1: "Build amazings neurofeedback sessions for everybody"**

**Vision 2: "Develop software and hardware solutions to assurance the ownership of the biodata of everybody"**

**Vision 3: "Use exponential technologies to improve the intelligence, logenvity and hapiness for everybody"**

Why do we have multiple visions?
--------------------------------

Because people don't all have to want the same thing. We're in this muLabsDAO together because we have a common set of values, not because we have to have the same vision and goals. People can work on whatever they are passionate about, and if enough other people share the same passion it implicitly becomes a muLabsDAO vision.

How we work with visions
------------------------

-   muLabsDAO can have several visions.
-   They can and should only be changed with [Proposals](proposals.html), so everyone can discuss.

Some Constraints 
---------------- 

There are some [industries that we avoid](industries-that-we-avoid.html).
