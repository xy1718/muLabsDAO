How muLabsDAO works
===================

Formally, muLabsDAO doesn't really have a focus area. Nothing about our model is specific to any domain or industry. Well, there are some [industries that we avoid](industries-that-we-avoid.html). Our strategy (it's really more about how we operate) is to focus in two main areas: 

1. **Develop software and hardware solutions using exponential technologies to improve intelligence, happiness and longevity**. Mostly longer engagements and close to full-time.
2. **Build singular Neurofeedback Experiences/Sessions/Events exploring the boundaries between science and art to learn more about how to quantify the self**. Mostly shorter engagements or part-time.

That is, most people of the team happen to spend most of their time in one of those two areas. Some have one foot in each though. The key thing is "keep the flow with the loops" - positive feedback cycles that keep getting stronger and stronger.

Positive feedback loops 
-----------------------

**Left loop:**

1. Competent & motivated people do a better job, which leads to happy customers.
2. Happy customers give us a good reputation.
3. Good reputation increases our motivation further & attracts new competent people to our DAO.
4. GOTO 1

**Right loop:**

1. Competent & motivated people do a better job, which leads to happy customers.
2. More and happier customers leads to higher profit.
3. Higher profit means people can afford to spend time learning new things (instead of trying to make every hour customer-debitable), and feel more safe doing so.
4. Taking time to explore and learn new things together makes us more motivated and more competent!
5. GOTO 1

How do we run the DAO?
----------------------

-   **Lean & Agile** - our approach is based on lean and [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) principles.
-   **Meritocracy & Consensus** - we don't have titles, managers, or reporting structures. Instead we are a [meritocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy), which basically means your power to influence stuff is based on your competence and engagement. Decisions are made mostly using consensus ([here's how](decisions.html)).
-   **Ask for forgiveness rather than permission** - if you want to start or change something, go ahead! The default answer to any request or idea is "Sure! If you believe in it and want to put time into it!". Very few mistakes are fatal or irreversible, so we encourage each other to just try things rather than seek permission.
-   **Simple models** - being a bunch of smart people and nerds, we can come up with detailed rules and structures for any kind problem. But we really try not to! We don't want to overcomplicate things, and prefer to err on the side of simplicity. Better to have too few rules than too many, and better to follow high level guiding principles than low level detailed procedures.

How do we finance muLabsDAO?
---------------------------

We are trying to raise funds with our BioNFT collections, promoting auctions in singular events like [A Journey to a neurofeedback](a-journey-to-neurofeedback.html).

What do we do with the money?
-----------------------------

Continue with the research and development of the [Brain Protocol](what-is-brain-protocol.html). Basically according our [proposals](proposals.html) we try to take the bests [decisions](decisions.html).
