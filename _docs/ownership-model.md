Ownership model
===============

muLabsDAO is a DAO. This means the shares are shared with everybody according the value of your participation, collaboration, task, effort. So who owns muLabsDAO, how are new owners brought in, and what does ownership mean?

Our model is simple: **anyone who has been at muLabsDAO for 2+ years can become an owner.**

> Why 2 years? Glad you asked! we **might** screw up and bring in a bad apple. We'll probably notice and get rid of a bad apple faster than 2 years! The 2 year rule reduces the risk that the bad apple is also a shareholder, which would complicate the getting-rid-of process.

Now you might thinking "Huh, so *anyone* is allowed to become a partner? Really?".

Exactly! The idea is that, if we wouldn't trust someone to co-own the DAO, why would we trust them to represent muLabsDAO at all? So if, after two years, we don't trust a people enough to offer them ownership, that's a sign they shouldn't be at muLabsDAO at all. So far this has never happened though.

> Actually, in the bad old days we used to have a kind of "selection process" for new partners. Most people hated it, felt like a stupid beauty contest of some sort, and the people who were NOT offered partnership were of course really disappointed and wondered why. So we ditched that model.

So, every year we send an invite to all non-owners who have been around for at least 2 years, and ask them if they want to become owners.

What does ownership cost?
-------------------------

We strive to minimize the financial value of the DAO. Yes, you heard it right. I know, that's like the opposite of what other organizations do. But remember, the purpose of muLabsDAO is not to enrich it's owners. The purpose is to [help people be more happy, intelligent and healthy](what-is-muLabsDAO.html).

> We've all seen companies that work like pyramid schemes - where old-timers are like fat cats parasiting from the hard work of newcomers. That's exactly what we **don't** want to be.

When you become an owner (which is entirely optional), you buy stock at that low price. You will have the exact same amount of stock as the other owners. And if/when you leave muLabsDAO, you must sell your stock back at basically the same price.

This means there is no financial incentive to own stocks, no cashing out.

What does ownership actually mean?
----------------------------------

Ownership means very little in practical terms. You won't get rich, and you won't gain more influence (power is gained through meritocracy, not ownership - see our [decision process](decisions.html)). In theory there are situations where ownership CAN make a difference, like if our normal decision process completely breaks down and we have to resort to shareholder voting for a critical decision. But that almost never happens.

So what's the point of being a shareholder? Well, it's mostly symbolic - the warm fuzzy feeling of co-owning this fine DAO. 

What if someone buys muLabsDAO?
-------------------------------

In theory someone could come along and shell out a bunch of cash to buy muLabsDAO, and in that case the owners would in a sense cash out. But with the current structure we see that as extremely unlikely. muLabsDAO itself is just a container, a platform. The real value is the people, and they aren't even employed by muLabsDAO. So although someone can technically buy muLabsDAO, they can't really buy the people inside muLabsDAO. And besides, who would buy a DAO that explicitly strives to minimize it's financial value :o)

But who knows. The world can be strange sometimes.
